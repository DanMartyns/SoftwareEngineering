In the first week, we decided the theme of our project and had our first
impressions about what it should be. Our ideas converged when we though in
a Smart Farm concept, which targets the sensing, monitoring and actuation
on farms around the globe, helping the farmers and this market to grow
efficiently. We called our product **SmartFarm**.

Our first step was to fill our specification (the scope, the rationale,
the sensors, the data processing and the UI) and to study more about what
we needed (e.g. deployment and automatic deployment methods integrating
Docker and Maven).

We also drafted a general description of the context, which includes use cases,
features, architecture, technical requirements and schedule.
