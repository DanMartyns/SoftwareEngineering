With one week left, we have completed the unit tests with an embedded broker on the SmartFarm Management micro-service.

We also have worked on the Jenkins deployment configuration, for Jenkins to fetch automatically our repository from GitLab and to send us an email whenever a build is successfully done, or has an error.

We also have introduced pattern matching on our log monitoring platform, to allow the developers an easier debugging.

Finally, we have run into some issues with the user authentication, mainly because of the CORS header in the requests to the server, and the token management from each browser.

Thankfully, it all has been worked out, and we are ready to show the scenarios, the deployment and the testes next week, on M6!
