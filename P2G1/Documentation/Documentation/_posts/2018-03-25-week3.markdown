This week we invested some time in improving our documentation, adding details, put the architecture into paper level and also improved the website design.

We went from only showing data to representing it with charts, in order to be **user friendly** and allow a quick visualization and comprehension. This values can now be inserted via keyboard, to make it easier to test and demonstrate in milestones.

We started studied about influxDB and making comparasions between it and Prometheus, and also between them and Riemann, in order to understand the best way to provide alerts to the user. Some decisions had been made in the matter of using Prometheus or InfluxDB; the group converged on learning more about kafka streams, which will be used also to alert the user in a variety of scenarios.

Last but not least, we improved our automatic deployment.
