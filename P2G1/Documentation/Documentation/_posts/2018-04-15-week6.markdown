This week we did the API documentation with Swagger and added the historic of sensors' values to dashboard.
We also finished adding persistence to the "static" values (farms, farm owners, employees...) and started adding persistence to the sensors alerts, in order to allow the user to define some thresholds desired to receive alerts using JPA and PostgreSQL.
The last but not the least, we reformatted our docker modules and updated our documentation.
