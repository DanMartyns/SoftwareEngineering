This week we have introduced *Kafka Streams* in our project. It was not easy, but we managed to use *Kafka Streams* to calculate the average from all the data sent from a sensor.

We have also used it to trigger an alert whenever a new value is received from a sensor.

Whenever a sensor received a new data, it also sends the status field. Also with kafka streams, if a sensor sends a status that is different from the previous one, the platform updates the sensor description with th new state.

We have fixed a major bug, where the databases would not persist data after the container was closed.

On the UI, the average values for a sensor are also displayed on the sensor data chart, allowing for an easier view of the received data from a sensor.
