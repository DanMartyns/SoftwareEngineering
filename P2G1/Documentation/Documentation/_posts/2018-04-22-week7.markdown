This week, the API documentation was finalized, which allows us to use the documentation to communicate with stubs between the UI and the backend.

The alert module was introduced, with maximum and minimum thresholds.

On the UI, the alerts page was added, as well as its insertion.

Many UI bugs were solved, related to the sensor page and the backend API's.
