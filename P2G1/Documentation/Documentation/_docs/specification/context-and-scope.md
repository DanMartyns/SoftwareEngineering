## Context

The main goal of the Heart Rate Monitor is to provide a user a live feed of how
his reaction to a video or game impacts his heart rate.
This live feed can also be helpful in a medical way, helping to define some users
fears or phobias.

## Scope

Using an external sensor that is connected to the user, the users heart rate is
sent to our application and can be seen in real time by the user.
Our application intents to be a tool that helps doctors define and take actions
regarding some fears or phobias that can be detected using our application (for 
example when a user is reacting to a video of spiders).
