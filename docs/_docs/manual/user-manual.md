## User Manual

On this section it is described the possible UI experience flows on the Heart Rate Monitor dashboard.

Since the objective of the developed application is to show in real time the user's heart rate, we use a ECG sensor capable of gathering the data from the user.
For that to be possible, the user must first place the three different leads in the corresponding position of the body.

This is fairly important, as it contributes to a more stable data without much noise.

After setting this up, the user can access to our dashboard.

As depicted in the image above, the dashboard is intuitive and shows the user everything he needs to know.

On the left side, we have the video or game that the user is reacting to. This is the main interaction that the user has with our application, since the whole purpose is to capture his reaction to what is playing on this side of the dashboard.

In the middle, we present the id of the sensor the user is using.

On the right side, and since the reaction is measured in heart beats per minute, the user can see in real time his beats per minute count.

What is expected is that when a user has a fear or phobie to what he is being subjected to by the video, his heart beat per minute counter go up, whereas if a peaceful video is showing, his heart beat counter go down.
